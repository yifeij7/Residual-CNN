## Residual CNN for Visible-NIR sensor demosaicing

Scripts:<br/>
residual_CNN.ipynb is the main code for the demosaicing model training and testing purposes.
H5toPNG.py is to process the original h5 into visible and NIR channels mosaiced PNG images as the input to the demosaicing model.

Data:<br/>
The training dataset is published at https://kedema.org/project/exploration/index.html
The testing dataset including all the images captured by bio-inspired Visible-NIR sensor is at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cgfuGcvctm38cmUXMjjBHGUl8CnhC3wN?usp=sharing
